- 👋 Hi, I’m @PyZanix otherwise know as Jared to my friends & family.
- 👀 I’m interested in penetration-testing, cryptocurrency, cyber-security, data-entry, programming & cryptocurrency trading bots.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about mobile app development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making a trading bot that has a 80%+ success rate with a 10% risk loss ratio for coinbase or alpaca or even bybit.
